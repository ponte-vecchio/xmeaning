# The `xmeaning` package

----

 The `xmeaning` package provides an enhanced interface for querying the meaning of a token. It improves upon the existing `\meaning` primitive by recognising five classes of tokens, for which the output is optimised.

The package also offers a starred variant that displays the meanings of internal auxiliary macros.
